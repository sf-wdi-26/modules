### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** – since you've already gotten your feet wet with Tic Tac Toe, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it (there will be a quick tutorial on this later in the week)
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** Create user-stories, draw wireframes, and write pseudocode! Spend a lot of time on this.
* **Use your Development Tools** (debugging, global variables, console.log, etc) to solve problems
* **Reference lessons** in class & ask questions to TAs & Instructors when you need to!
* **Commit often!** Commit *at least* every time to complete a user story. Then you don’t have to be afraid to break something, as you can always go back in time to older version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** You are encouraged to create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate it until then.

### Suggestions

##### Blackjack
User bets money on guessing which card the computer will deal next!

##### Typing Race
The user has to type letters that appear on the screen. They score points for every correct letter and advance their racer character across the screen!

##### Trivia
Test your wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you care about. User can guess answers and have the computer validate them!

##### Concentration (Memory)
A card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. User should be able to pick the cards and win once they matched them all!

##### Battleship
User can challenge the computer, each takes a turn trying to sink the other ships. The player who sinks the other player's ships first wins!

##### Something Else!
Make sure you get the approval of your [squad](http://bit.ly/1nZsVo9)'s instructor if you choose anything else.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
