# Your own Web App using Sinatra!

## Start Spreading the News!

1. Copy (`cp -r path/to/original path/to/destination`) the starter code into its own folder (outside of any existing git repo)

2. Create RESTful routes like we did in class. Use the lecture notes from today as a guide.

3. Create views for each GET route.

4. Give it a little style! Add bootstrap if you like.

5. Follow KISS (Keep it simple stupid) conventions and reach out to your fellow classmates for help if you get stuck!

6. Not working? Ask yourself the following questions:
  - Did you `bundle`?
  - Did you save your files?
  - Did you start the server using `rackup`?
  - Did you restart the server after making changes?
  - Are you on the right port? `9292`
  - Does Sinatra give you any friendly errors?
  - Does your terminal give you any errors?

  - Also note: Always stop the server before you close your terminal window! Failure to do so will leave the server running in the background and give you an error next time you try to start it. You will learn to fix that in a matter of seconds later, but try to avoid it for now.

7. Commit often.
 
### Deliverables:
  This should be done as its own repo on your GH. Submit a readme with a link to the repo to your homework folder.
