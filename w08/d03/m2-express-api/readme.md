| Objectives |
| :--- |
| Add the Handlebars.js library to an Express project |
| Starter code establishes best practices in RESTful API |
| Consume an external API (Spotify) while building your own |

## Setup

Fork and clone [this repo](https://github.com/sf-wdi-26/express-spotify-search)

1. Carefully add the contents of your basic spotify search `main.js` to `/public/scripts/main.js` and remove conflicts.
2. Carefully add the spotify search markup to the Express app `index.hbs` and resolve conflicts.
3. Add the loading.gif file to the `/public` directory and copy over the relevant CSS

#### What are the conflicts?

* You cannot declare the same variable twice in JavaScript unless they have different scope.
* You cannot have two elements with the same id in HTML
* You cannot have two Handlebars templates with the same id
