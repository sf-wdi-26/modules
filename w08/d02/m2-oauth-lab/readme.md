# Adding more OAuth Options Lab
## Introduction

We've covered the concept of OAuth and how to implement it using Express and `passport-facebook`. Let's take an app we've previously worked on and allow for social login using Github.

## Exercise

Take a look at the [GitHub OAuth API docs](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/).

#### Requirements

- Take the code from your last module and add Github Login to it.
- Make sure the strategy doesn't create two users if you authenticate with GitHub and Facebook.

**Bonus:**
- Add Google OAuth as well!

#### Starter code

Can be either your own code from the last module, or the solution-code from there.
