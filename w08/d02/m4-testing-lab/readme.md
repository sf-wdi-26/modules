# A Numbers Game

## Goal

* Build a JavaScript calculator using TDD.
* The `calculator` object can perform mathematical operations, i.e. `calculator.add(x, y)`.

###Features

* add two numbers with `.add`
* subtract two numbers with `.subtract`
* multiply two numbers with `.multiply`
* divide two numbers with `.divide`
* square one number with `.square`
* raise one number to the power of another with `.exponential`
* find the larger of two numbers with `.isGreaterThan`
* find the sign of a number with `.isNegative` (return a `boolean`)

## Advice

* Write one test first, watch it fail, then write the code to pass it.
* Don't write multiple tests at once. Focus on one feature at a time.
* Ping pong with someone.

>This means that person A writes the first test. Then Person B passes that test and writes the second test. Thereafter, person A passes the second test and writes the third test. Do you see the pattern yet? Now, person B passes the third test and writes the fourth test, and so on!
