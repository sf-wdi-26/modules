# Express Helpers

Express Helpers is a port of EJS's ViewHelpers and additional helpers are very similar to those found in the Ruby on Rails framework.

## Installation
   
    npm install express-helpers
    
## How to use

Require express and create a server.

    var express = require('express');
	var app = express.createServer();

To automatically inclue all helpers initialize like this. 

	var helpers = require('express-helpers')(app);

Or more simply if you don't need any reference to the helpers object

    require('express-helpers')(app);
	
If you want to only use some helpers require without the app and register necessary view helpers...

## Express 3.0

    var helpers = require('express-helpers')();

    app.locals.date_tag = helpers.date_tag;
    
**Note: The is_current_page and link_to_unless_current helpers are not available like this since they need to be setup as middleware**    
    
## Express 2.0

    var helpers = require('express-helpers')();

    app.helpers({
       date_tag: helpers.date_tag
    });

Then use it in a ejs view like a rails view

    <% form_for("user", function(f){ %>
        <%- f.label_for("username") %>
        <%- f.text_field("username") %><br />

        <%- f.submit() %><br />
    <% }) %>
