# Express Routing Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, we're going to begin with the code from the monring lessons and slowly explore the Express.js documentation to figure out how to create routes and curl them from the terminal. There is no database so data will not persist when you restart your server.

- What comes in Express?
- What is middle-ware?
- How do we put this together?
- How do we factor with OOP concepts?
