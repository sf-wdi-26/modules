## What Can We Do with Express (Review)?

**Core Concepts and Brainstorming**

* Server-side JS
	* Instead of DOM manipulation, we are interacting with the request / response cycle
* (B.Y.O.A.) Build your own API
	* What kind of data do you want to work with?



### Setup

Let's start with a simple **Express** application.

* Inside your homework repo, make a directory and `index.js`  

	``` bash
	mkdir quick_example
	cd quick_example/
	touch index.js
	```

* Then create a `package.json`, use the first line below or `npm init`.

	``` bash
	echo {} > package.json		#puts an empty object into a new `package.json`
	npm install --save express
	npm install --save ejs # if you want to use the templating
	subl .
	```
The folder structure will be as follows:
```
/quick_example
    /node_modules
        /express
            ...
    index.js
    package.json

```

Now we need write some code for our simple application.


`index.js`

``` javascript
// requirements
var express = require('express'),
	app = express();

// a "GET" request to "/" will run the function below
app.get("/", function (req, res) {
	// send back the response: 'Hello World'
	res.send("Hello World");
});

// start the server
app.listen(3000, function () {
	console.log("Go to localhost:3000/");
});

```

Now you can start the server:

``` bash
node index.js
```

## What is Routing (RESTful review)?

Building an application will require us to have a firm grasp of something we call **routing**.  Each **route** is a combination of a **Request Type** and **Path**.

| Request Type | Request Path | Response
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/` | `Hello World` |
| `GET` | `/burgers` | `Hamburger`, `Cheese Burger`, `Dble Cheese Burger` |
| `GET` | `/tacos` | `Soft Taco`, `Crunchy Taco`, `Super Taco` |


Let's build these into our application:

`index.js`

``` javascript
var express = require('express'),
	app = express();

var burgers = [
				"Hamburger",
				"Cheese Burger",
				"Dble Cheese Burger"
			   ];

var tacos = [
				"Soft Taco",
				"Crunchy Taco",
				"Super Taco"
			   ];

app.get("/", function (req, res) {
	res.send("Hello World");
});

app.get("/burgers", function (req, res) {
	//send all the burgers	   
	res.send(burgers.join(", "));
});

app.get("/tacos", function (req, res) {
	//send all the tacos		   
	res.send(tacos.join(", "));
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
	console.log("Go to localhost:3000/");
});

```

## Request (Url) Parameters

What if we want to create an app that can dynamically say hello to anyone?

* Using **url parameters** add a dynamic route to the application, indicated by `:` and the variable name you want to use, we'll use `:name` for the example below.

``` javascript
// another example of some simple middleware
// call this function on every route with the param of 'name'
app.param('name', function(request, response, next) {
	// get name from params
  var name = request.params.name;
	// capitalize the name
  var capitalizedName = name[0].toUpperCase() + name.slice(1).toLowerCase();
	// set the value of the name to the capitalized version
  request.params.name = capitalizedName;
	// pass control to the next middleware function
  next();
})

app.get("/greet/:name", function (req, res) {
	res.send( "Hello, " + req.params.name );
});
```

Here we are seeing the first introduction to parameters that the application can identify. In the following route `:name` is consider a route parameter. We can access it using `req.params.name`.

| Request Type | Request Path | Response
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/greet/:name` | `Hello, :name` |


## Query Params

Generally, you don't want to cram everything into a route. Just imagine when there are multiple parameters in route. Or maybe we don't care about getting the order of the parameters correct. Luckily, there are **query parameters** you can include with each request.

Let's see query params in action. Go to [https://google.com/search?q=kittens&tbm=isch](https://google.com/search?q=kittens&tbm=isch)

* `?` denotes the beginning of the query parameters
* `=` indicates an assignment; anything to the left is the key, while the right represents the value
* `&` allows for the input of multiple parameters, separating each

Let's add our first route to practice query params.

``` javascript
app.get("/thank", function (req, res) {
	var name = req.query.name;
	res.send("Thank you, " + name);
});
```

Reset your server and go to [localhost:3000/thank?name=jane](localhost:3000/thank?name=jane). Note how we can now define parameters in the url after a `?`.

## Middleware (Review)

What is middleware? [In terms of Express](http://expressjs.com/guide/using-middleware.html), middleware is a function with access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle, commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware can:

* Execute any code.
* Make changes to the request and the response objects.
* End the request-response cycle.
* Call the next middleware in the stack.

You can create your own middleware, or use third-party modules. That's right, there are tons of useful middlewares that are already out there which you can use to handle common challenges like authentication, validations, and parsing.

The [`body-parser`](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) module is an example of some middleware that makes Express awesome. You can use it to parse out params from the POST'd form. This provides a different way to collect data instead of relying on URL or query params.

`server.js`
```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

var ejs = require('ejs');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
// bodyParser.urlencoded() returns a function that will be called later in the app.post() route
var parseUrlencoded = bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false});

// store for cities in memory (as long as server is running)
var cities = [];

app.get('/cities', function(req, res) {
    res.render('cities', {cities: cities});
})

// passing multiple middleware functions to this route; they are executed sequentially.
app.post('/cities', parseUrlencoded, function (request, response) {
  var city;
  var name = request.body.name;
  var description = request.body.description;
  city = { name: name, description: description}
  cities.push(city);
	// passing local variables to be used in EJS template
  response.render('cities', { cities: cities});
});
```

`cities.ejs`
```html
<h1>Cities</h1>
<ul>
<% for(var i = 0; i< cities.length; i++) {%>
   <li><%= cities[i].name %> <%= cities[i].description %></li>
<% } %>
</ul>

<form action="/cities" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name">
  <input type="text" name="description">
  <input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>
```

## Summary

We learned about

* Routing to different resources, i.e. `/burgers` and `/tacos`
* Using dynamic parameters, i.e. `/burgers/:index` and `/tacos/:index` to request specific data
* Using query parameters for dynamic requests to serve up dynamic responses
* What middleware is and why it is helpful


This will be essential knowledge for building and interacting with applications that contain multiple resources, such as users, posts, comments, etc.
