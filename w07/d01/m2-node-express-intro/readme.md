## Recapping Node and Intro to Express - Intro (5 mins)

#### First let's review

* What is Node?

Node is a low-level, non-blocking, event-driven platform which allows you to write JavaScript on the server-side.

* What is npm?

npm is Node's package manager. It's used to manage dependencies. Think of it like RubyGems.

#### What is express.js?

Express.js is a simple web framework for Node.js. It provides many features for you to start using right away (Routing, Sessions) that you would have to do yourself if using vanilla Node. Think of it like **Sinatra for Node**.

## Let's create a server using Node and Express - Codealong (15 mins)

Get to it:

1. `mkdir twitter-stream`
2. `cd twitter-stream`
3. `npm init` (Hit enter to accept the defaults and see the new [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) file
4. `npm install express --save` (`--save` will mean it gets added to the project dependencies, this is similar to a gem but you can see it!)
5. `touch app.js` in twitter-stream directory

Check out the package.json file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.11.1"
}
```

Let's start coding!

```javascript
// app.js

var express = require('express');
var app     = express();
var port    = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World');
});


app.listen(port);
console.log('Server started on ' + port);
```

Notice the get verb here - this can also be post, put, delete, etc. Then run the app using:

```bash
node app.js
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and voila!

Now this is pretty awesome (isn't it?) but it doesn't really do anything. Plus, what if we want to start creating pages instead of just using sending text?

> Note: Zip the app in the starter code folder and send it to the students, the students unzip it and will work on it

## Templates in Express - Codealong (10 mins)

Express comes with a default templating engine called [jade](http://jade-lang.com), a high performance template engine heavily influenced by [HAML](http://haml.info).  Like HAML, jade simplifies writing html by eliminating the need for parts of html tags and utilizing white space.  

But this is a bit different than what we've been using with ERB; explore jade/haml on your own, but we'll be using another common templating engine called [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) (Embedded JavaScript) which is similar to ERB.

Instead of sending some text when we hit our site let's have it serve an index page.

#### Install ejs
```
npm install ejs --save
```
You can install from a project with:

```
npm uninstall ejs --save
```

#### Setting up ejs and render the index


Again, we'll use EJS, at least in the beginning, because the syntax has no learning curve (very similar to ERB). To change your rendering engine you'll need to edit your apps configuration in `app.js`. We also have to change what happens when a user GETs '/'. Let's get it to render our index template instead of sending 'Hello World'.

```javascript
// app.js

var express = require('express');
var app     = express();
var port    = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.set('views', './views');
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');  

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    res.render('index');
});

app.listen(port);
console.log('Server started on ' + port);
```

Notice that we have added:

```javascript
res.render('index');
```

#### Creating views in Express

How about an ejs index page:

```bash
touch views/index.ejs
```

And add this code:

```
  <!doctype html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Welcome to express.js!></title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Express and Jade</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p> This is a paragraph of text. Yay! </p>
    </div>
  </body
```

#### Logging in Express with Middleware - Codealong (10 mins)

You may have seen this word floating around or seen it when you did Sinatra (Rack Middleware). It's a bit of a funny concept but think about it as _something_ that sits in-between Express and you...kind of. Let me show you with an example.

In our Hello World app we are logging out the server port once it has started - that is it. We get no other information about requests or errors like we have in Rails. We can use _Middleware_ to achieve this.

Add the following to your app.js file:

```javascript
// app.js
.
.
.
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// Middelware
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  console.log('%s request to %s from %s', req.method, req.path, req.ip);
  next();
});

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
.
.
.
```

Let's go through this. After setting up our app and before our routes we tell our app to use a new function we are providing. That's all Middleware is! When writing custom Middleware, it's best practice to pass in the **req** object, the **res** object and finally **next**, _even if we don't use it!_ In this case, we are simply logging out the request method ('GET'), the request path ('/') and the request IP ('127.0.0.1' - localhost).


## Routing in Express - Intro (5 mins)

We know how routes look in Sinatra:

```ruby
get "/" do
  erb "WDI is awesome."
end

get "/songs" do
  @songs = ["Fly Me To The Moon", "New York, New York", "Luck Be A Lady"]
  erb :'songs'
end
```

Let's look at routes and handler callback functions in Express routes:

```javascript
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('welcome');
});
```

Just like Sinatra, routes in Express are created using methods named after HTTP verbs. In the example above, we created a route to respond to GET requests at the root of the app. You will have a corresponding method on the app object for all the HTTP verbs.  In this example, we'll send back the `welcome` view as a response.

## Adding Routes to our app - Codealong (15 mins)

Let's add some routes. This should all be familiar but let's go through it.

[ExpressJS 4.0](https://scotch.io/tutorials/learn-to-use-the-new-router-in-expressjs-4) comes with the new Router. Router is like a mini Express application. It doesnâ€™t bring in views or settings but provides us with the routing APIs like `.use`, `.get`, `.param`, and `route`.

First we define our _router_. This is what handles our routing. It's normally better to use this way of doing routes (and extracting them in to their own files) as it makes applications more modular, and you won't have a 500 line app.js.

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app     = express();
var port    = process.env.PORT || 3000;
var router  = express.Router();
```

This needs to be under the definition of `var app`!  Then we add our routes.

```javascript
router.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.render('index', { header: 'index!'});
});

router.get('/contact', function(req, res) {
  res.render('contact', { header: 'contact!'});
});

router.get('/about', function(req, res) {
  res.render('about', { header: 'about!'});
});
```

At the bottom of the page add:

```javascript
app.use('/', router);
```

As we saw before we are rendering our template and then passing in a local variable (_header_) to use in our template, just like instance variables defined in our controller or layouts that we passed to our views in Rails.

## Restful Routing - Intro (10 mins)

As we've already seen with Sinatra, we will use the RESTful standard to build our web apps. At the moment, we've just covered how to handle GET requests, but we can create callbacks for all types of requests. For example, if we want to create a restful controller for the resource cars,it will look like that:

```javascript

var carRouter = express.Router();

carRouter.get('/', function(req, res) {
  // INDEX
});

carRouter.get('/:id', function(req, res) {
  // SHOW
});

carRouter.get('/new', function(req, res) {
  // NEW
});

carRouter.post('/', function(req, res) {
  // CREATE
});

carRouter.get('/:id/edit', function(req, res) {
  // SHOW
});

carRouter.put('/:id', function(req, res) {
  // UPDATE
});

carRouter.delete('/:id', function(req, res) {
  // DELETE
});


app.use("/cars", carRouter)
```

We've defined that the endpoint for the car resource will be "/cars".
So the code above will create these 7 routes:

```javascript

GET    /cars
GET    /cars/:id
GET    /cars/new
POST   /cars
GET    /cars/:id/edit
PUT    /cars/:id
DELETE /cars/:id

```

## BodyParser and handling params/JSON - Intro (5) mins)

When data is sent to the server via a POST request, the content of the request is passed as a string, but we want to access it as if it was a JSON object:

If we have a form like this:

```html
    <form>
      <input type="text" name="book[title]">
      <input type="text" name="book[author]">
    </form>
```

Once this form is submitted, by default, the data on the server will look like this:

```json
{
  "book[title]"  : "value",
  "book[author]" : "value"
}
```

...but this is not really convenient, as accessing the data will be a bit complex to parse:

```javascript
req.body['book[title]']
```

It would be a bit more easy if we could use the data like:

```javascript
req.body.book.title
```

For this we will use `body-parser`.

## Configure your app to use body-parser - Codealong (10 mins)

First add the package to your `package.json` dependencies:

```json
"body-parser": "^1.13.2"
```

Now in `app.js`, add:

```javascript
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

```

The params passed with a request will be "decoded" automatically, allowing you to use dot notation when working with JavaScript objects.

If you are writing an api, meant to receive and send JSON, you would change the line above to:

```javascript
app.use(bodyParser.json());
```

Now the app will decode all JSON received in the body of a client request.


## Independent Practice (15 minutes)

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

In the same file, try to create the 7 Restful Routes for the resource "car". Every method should return some text saying the HTTP Verb, which URI has been used to do the request and which REST action it corresponds to.

Example, for a POST request to `/cars` the text sent back should be:

```
POST request to /cars, this is the CREATE action
```

Also, test your application with `cURL` requests to each of the RESTful endpoints.

## Conclusion (5 mins)
A framework can be overwhelming at the start, after a couple of days you will see how it makes your life easier.  We will work more on how to make RESTful controllers, this is just an introduction.

- What is Middleware and why is it helpful in Exrpess?
- Explain how body-parser helps decode information in your application.
- Identify some similarities and differences between Express and Sinatra.
