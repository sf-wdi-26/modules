# Fellowship of the Ring DOM Manipulation

## Introduction

*This can be a pair programming activity or done independently.*

To practice manipulating the DOM, we've provided you with a series of steps in a `.js` file.  Create a function for each of the steps to practice DOM Manipulation and JavaScript. These should each be called in order after the window has loaded.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Open the `/fellowships.js` file in the [starter-code](starter-code/app/) This is where you will work. Define and invoke the functions outlined as comments.
- There are 12 steps in total.  Try to get through at least the first five in this lab period.

**Bonus:**

- Within the click event listener for clicking `'#the-ring'`, add functionality so that when it's clicked, it not only calls `nazgulScreech` but also causes Frodo's opacity to go down to 0 for a while, only to fade back in.
- If the ring is clicked three times, the entire body element should disappear, to be replaced with the text "The Ring has been returned to Sauron and the world is over."

#### Starter code

As mentioned above, check out [`starter-code/app/scripts/fellowship.js`](starter-code/app/scripts/fellowship.js) to get moving.

#### Deliverable

Your solution should look a little something like this:
