## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

###Description


Imagine it's 13 months from now, and you've started taking on work as a freelance developer.  So far you've done work for (imaginary) companies like Relaxr, Startup Matchmaker, and Citipix, and you want to showcase the web apps and landing pages you've built for them.  Take what you've learned from class and the prework and build a portfolio site, using HTML and simple CSS, that showcases your hard work from the past 13 months.

Create two pages - an 'About Page' and a 'Portfolio' - that link to one another. Your 'About Page' should describe your mission and value proposition and your 'Portfolio' should include [screenshots](starter-code/images) with descriptions of the work you've done for the companies mentioned above. Don't worry if you can't come up with any text for the pages--we've provided you with [some sample copy](starter-code/sample-copy.txt) that you can use.


#### Requirements

- Link both pages together using `a` tag
- Use a unique `title` and a single unique `h1` tag
- Show images using `img` tags including unique `alt` attributes
- Use an external CSS stylesheet to style your pages
- Select at least 5 elements on the page and apply at least 5 different css properties (`font-size`, `color`, `font-family`, `background`, `text-decoration`) to these elements
- Use at least 6 different HTML tags (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `a`, `img`) on your pages
- Follow naming conventions, maintain consistency across your .html and .css files
- Indent nested elements to increase your code's readability

**Bonus**:

- Experiment by adding additional HTML tags and CSS properties we did not cover in class - explore!



#### Starter code

There is **no starter code** for this assignment (only [starter text](starter-code/sample-copy.txt)). You're going to build this assignment from scratch and should feel free to get creative with regard to layout, color, styling, etc.

#### Deliverable

Here are examples of a simple "About" and "Portfolio" page that fulfill the assignment requirements:

- Joe, the freelance developer's "about page":
